Notes:

1. In pom.xml / build.gradle, include the security starter pack
- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security

2. Just by including above plug-in, security is disable & password is not displayed in console
- password : Not Displayed on the console 
[Using generated security password: 01eb0422-60e2-4f58-85bc-d95fc716a393]

# For applying Security using Authentication

1. Enable Web security in Security Configuration file
@EnableWebSecurity

2. Extends to WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

- It accepts username, password & authorities using inMemoryAuthentication

4. Override configure(HttpSecurity http) 
- - Mention authorizeRequest with pattern to authenticate & mention authentication type [formLogin]
